This format is always a dead giveaway:\n\n>\tThe presence of lung surfactants influences drug deposition in multiple ways, such as:\n\n>Diffusion limitation: The surfactant layer might act as a barrier, hindering drugs from reaching deeper tissues. This can lead to reduced drug concentrations in the lungs and diminished treatment effectiveness.\n\n>\tExtended residence time: The surfactant layer can prolong the duration of time that the drugs linger in the lungs. This is beneficial for drugs that are rapidly expelled, as it allows for extended exposure to lung tissue, which enhances their potency.\n\n>\tDrug particle dimensions: The size of the drug particles affects their deposition depth in the lungs. Larger particles might be trapped atop the surfactant layer, which limits their penetration, while smaller particles might navigate past the layer to access the deeper lung regions.\n\n>\tIn essence, lung surfactants can enhance deposition by ensuring even alveolar expansion during inhalation and enhancing alveolar resistance to collapse upon exhalation [33].",
