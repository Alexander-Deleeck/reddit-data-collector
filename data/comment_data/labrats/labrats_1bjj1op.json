Bunsen said of the compounds,\n\n\"The smell of this body produces instantaneous tingling of the hands and feet, and even giddiness and insensibility... It is remarkable that when one is exposed to the smell of these compounds the tongue becomes covered with a black coating, even when no further evil effects are noticeable\".\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacodylic_acid\n\nFun times all round.",

And solvent bottles that had the bare min of info stored for decades which no one could say why it still existed. \nI think the take away is in industry we are proactive. In academia it's as needed.
