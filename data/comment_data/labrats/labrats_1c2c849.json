Trick was I just kept using it to get another free antibody because I was working with axolotls and everything was novel \ud83d\ude02\n\nMy scam pretty much funded most of my gradschool research, and I got like 6 new antibodies out of it. The customer services is super friendly and they're the ones you call for the discount codes and they make it pretty easy on you NGL. \n\nPlus they give like customer rewards for each post and I accumulated like $300 worth of Amazon gift cards at the end of my masters.",

Even if you have a working cell bank of a stable line and a properly developed process, it's hard to make the economics pencil at a small scale. $400 is like a day's salary for a scientist making $105k not including overhead. Cell culture media is expensive.  Protein A resin is expensive. Fluorescent dyes can be expensive.  QCing the material isn't straightforward and a failed batch is expensive.",

                "text": "Buying the heavy and light chain plasmids (assuming you outsource cloning and synthesis) would be about \u00a31k. You generally need 1mg total DNA per litre so have to pay per maxiprep (around \u00a350 per prep). Media and transfection reagent generally cost around \u00a31k per litre plus additional media to bulk up the cells. Transfect, then harvest after 5 days, purify with protein A and (optional) SEC, concentrate using Amicons (single use, around \u00a310 each) and QC the protein with SDS-PAGE and optional endotoxin testing (single use, around \u00a315 per endotoxin cartridge). A nice antibody gets upwards of 100 mg/L expression, a bad one as low as 5 mg/L (or zero!!). You can lose up to 50% of your product during purification, especially if the biophys sucks. Then if it's for flow you'd additionally need to couple the fluorophore. \nWe used to quote an overall turnaround time including DNA synthesis of 10 weeks for an efficient internal platform and transfected around 20 L per week. Obviously I'm talking a much larger scale than you'd need for a casual flow experiment but the timescale and percentage loss is similar for small batches.",

There's a product I ordered 2 years ago, was supposed to arrive in 2 weeks. Then approximately every 10 days I'd get a notification , roughly saying \"oh this is delayed, dispatch date is in 2 weeks). For 17 FCKIN MONTHS.  After like 3 months I had told them I don't care, this is obviously not coming, cancel the order. They said it was already delivered in their warehouse and they could not cancel the order. Yet it took another 14 months to be delivered ?\n\n\nLately same company, they send a quote saying product dispatched in two days if the order is placed. I call them, they confirm they have they have it and can deliver it that fast. 1 week later (4 days past due date), dispatch date is delayed by 3 weeks. 2 weeks later they delay it one week further. I'm still waiting to see what will happen. And when you call them they're just useless and can't give you anymore information than what's on the website. Asked them to actually get on top of it, call the supplier and not send an email that would get a reply in 2 working days, as it's a product we needed urgently 3 weeks ago and THEY told us they had it in stock\nThe rep's reply \" alright mr. x, i'll send an email to the supplier and get a reply in the next 48 hours\". Fuck'em really.\n\nGot to the bottom of it, learned that the supplier actually makes the product on demand, the distributor had no stock of it, they just straight up lied about it.\n\n\nI'm sorry, this is all recent and i'm obviously still furious over this nonsense!",
