For most places it's a 2-3 year cycle of slow expansion followed by hiring freezes and layoffs.

Academia usually ask for CV.\n\nResume on the other hand, is very customizable. Resume is basically a highlight of CV. Industry usually ask for resume (although I submitted both CV and resume when applying anyway for the most part). I put my education, experience, select publications, select awards and honors, and skills. You can definitely change out words and expressions to best meet the job description. The emphasis of the resume for me was the experience part. And the skill section was where I did the most customizing to fit the job description. Out of the skill sets I have, I put the skill sets the employer was looking for (did not lie, I just selected from my existing skill set). Resume is usually 1\\~2 pages, but I kept it down to 1 page for simplicity of viewing, so it was a heck of a task trying to condense what I wanted to emphasize without shrinking the text size too much (I used 11pt, with narrow margin).",
