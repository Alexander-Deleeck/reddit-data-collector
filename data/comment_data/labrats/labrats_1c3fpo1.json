I've recently designed automation drivers for a hot plate/stirrer unit and found several possible cases where the unit, when operated manually in certain conditions, could lose all temp control and heat up continually to the point of causing fires, with no failsafe system preventing it. I was in contact with the manufacturer and asked for their firmware team to fix it. They provided a new firmware saying the issue was solved but it was not, and then they refused to address the issue further.\n\nSome time later, I heard that a fire had started in our customer's lab, caused by this piece of shit hot plate, and damaged other pieces of equipment. I had warned them of course that the stirrer was a safety risk, but they just dismissed the issue (they had just bought a whole lot of these plates).",

Everything was centralized in a single PIC MCU, no secondary control loop, no mechanical thermostat failsafe (WTF?). Basically the only peripherals outside of the UI were the output drivers for heat and stirring, a thermistor input (MCU internal ADC was used) and a RPM input for the stirrer.\n\nSince everything was centralized in the MCU, all of the behavior was dictated by the software. What was happening is that the heat control loop was never actually \"off\", and when an invalid setpoint was configured (outside of the supported temp range or even NaN), the control loop would just heat the plate attempting to reach the NaN temperature... The \"Off\" state was implemented by internally matching the setpoint to the current temperature (WTF!?) which couldn't happen if the setpoint was invalid.\n\nIt was very easy to demonstrate when controlling it using the serial port, but even when just using the front panel, it was possible to enter an invalid value for the setpoint (for example a negative value in \u00b0C) and the plate would just heat up continually even if it's \"off\".\n\nThe machine itself was pretty good-looking and felt like it was a quality device. One couldn't guess the terrible engineering inside of it. \n\nTheir \"fix\" was to prevent the user from entering a negative temp setpoint, but it didn't cover all the possible invalid values that could be entered, and it was still possible to send a negative setpoint using the serial port.",

Transfer in a walk in 4 degree at anything less than 0.2A is not going to have issues with heat dissipation, and I suspect a side by side comparison of blots done with and without stirring would be uninteresting, even for a 1 hour 0.8A transfer. \n\nBut hey, I've never tried it so maybe I'm wrong.",
