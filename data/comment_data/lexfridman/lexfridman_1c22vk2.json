        "text": "Check out old episodes of Firing Line hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. - He is a big conservative mouthpiece, but the guests and debates that happened on his show were outstanding. The episodes are like an hour long and some of the best content I have seen as far as political debates go. The show ran from 1966 to 1999, but I think the best content was in the earlier years. Here is an episode from 1969 with Noam Chomsky on the topic of Vietnam - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DvmLMUfGss&pp=ygUhdGhlIGZpcmluZyBsaW5lIHdpbGxpYW0gZiBidWNrbGV5",

I agree with you saying Israel is a colonial state is kind of silly. But the fact is Palestinians are just as indigenous. Genetic research suggests the fact that while the Arab conquests were incredibly influential in terms of culture and religion, it didn't have a huge affect on the genetic makeup of native peoples in conquered regions. Palestinians have significant Canaanite ancestry, Canaanite and Israelite ancestry are effectively indistinguishable so chances are a decent chunk of those Canaanite ancestors were probably Hebrew. Also tbf having ancestry from a region probably shouldn't give carte blanche to take over a land. Their best claim to the land is that they currently live on it. Two states is probably the best way to go bcs of this. No solution should involve the removal of another population I think",

The ethnic makeup of Israel is more diverse than just descendants of people who lived there thousands of years ago. \n\nI mean shit, if we're going back that far then shouldn't every country have a claim to Africa since humanity originated from there lol. \n\nIsraelis themselves called it a settler colonial project according to Benny Morris's book 1948. \n\nThe most apparent part of this being a settler colonialism is the settlements where Palestineans have to live in a 2 tiered society were Israeli settlers can kill them with immunity.\n\nDo you think every diaspora is entitled to a homeland recognized by the UN?(the organization that legitimized Israel)",

Finkelstein's accusations only worked when Morris wasn't around to provide clarification or admit that he's changed his mind since he wrote it based on new information. Not that Finkelstein gave any indication he was even listening to Morris's answers. For most of that interview he would give a sermon then stare off into space whenever someone other than himself started talking. \n\n>Norman Finkelstein knows more about this conflict than Destiny ever will\n\nIf that's true he should have taken the opportunity to prove it during the debate instead of childish name calling and getting told he was wrong by Morris whenever he got something wrong or just straight up made something up. \n\nIt's not enough to have the profession and certification. Norm had to use that education and he didn't. The reason is he was there to push a narrative and agenda. Not have a professional conversation about history.",

I've read most of Bennys books, a good amount of Finkelsteins. I read a lot of Zionist theory, and also rely a lot on eye witness accounts and video footage. It was incredibly clear to me Destiny went into this debate having made a concise decision regarding a conflict he knew maybe 20 percent about, MAYBE 20 percent. This conflict is so deep and multi layered, not to mention so much of Israeli documents that were released in the 80s changed the trajectory of how historians view this conflict. There's also still a large amount of Israeli documents still classified that would provide tremendous insight into many of the questions historians have regarding the conflict, Israel refuses to declassify them even though their limitations have expired.\n\nI disagree, as someone who is quite familiar with Bennys work, I think what he did was simply backtrack, not because he changed his mind, but because it didn't support his current argument. Also, you can't change your mind on facts, or historical accuracies. I've always respected Morris as a historian because he was committed to historical accuracy even if it made Israel look bad, as he's gotten older he's become more and more supportive of the propaganda machine, probably because Israel is losing the PR war. \n\nIs Norman Finkelstein rude, sure. Does he know what he's talking about, yes. Does he have the sources to back it up, yes. I could really care less about him insulting Destiny. Destiny is a streamer known for his racist, rude, and entitled comments, I care about the political content, that's really it.",

But as a Jewish American I can say this entire sentiment of calling an entire race a problem that needs to be dealt with is a terroristic approach. Yes, Hitler was a terrorist. Its not just middle eastern people.... also, replacing a developed country with a thriving economy and installing Hamas? I'm sorry but that just sounds illogical and irrational. I'm not racist against the people of Gaza. They deserve better. However, it's not surprising considering Israel has a far right government right now. In addition, I find it troublesome that women appear to have less freedom in places outside of Israel.",
