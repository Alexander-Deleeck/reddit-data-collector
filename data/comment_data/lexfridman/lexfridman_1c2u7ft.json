Not only is this blatantly false, but he explicitly called Finkelstein a liar, even though he has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nThe Guardian\n\nBut journalists who attended the scene in the immediate aftermath of the attack \u2013 including a reporter from the Guardian \u2013 saw a small and dilapidated fisherman's hut containing a few tools where the children had been playing hide-and-seek.\n\nDestiny says Palestinians rejection of the Camp David Summit offer is proof that it's impossible to make peace with them (until they abandon armed resistance alltogether). This is the map of the final offer. Anyone with eyeballs can look at the map and see it's a completely unreasonable offer and the Palestinians were completely legitimate in rejecting it.\n\nDestiny says the Palestinian position is \"delusional\", despite the fact that pretty much the entire world supports the Palestinian position, only Israel and the US rejects it. Ever single year the vote in the UN assembly is around 159-7. I guess the entire world is wrong and only Israel is rational?\n\nDestiny says \"plausible\" is an incredibly low standard, what he's forgetting is that it's not like if Israel barely clears the bar for not committing genocide that points to a serious and professionally run campaign that respects international law. Officially, this is supposed to be a serious war only targeting Hamas, the fact that things have gone so horribly that 15 out of 17 judges are willing to hear out whether a genocide is being committed is a sign turns have turned pretty horrible. The US campaign in Iraq was quite nasty in many ways, but no one thinks it's a remotely plausible genocide, and for that war it's pretty much a given across the entire political spectrum outside the neocons you oppose the Iraq War, primarily on moral grounds.\n\nDestiny has implied the casualty rates are normal, nothing is further from the truth. And this goes for almost any metric you use, the casualty rates are atrocious. Can anyone name a war where almost as many women die as men?\n\nDestiny says peace will only come if the Palestinians completely lay down their arms and pinky promise to never do any violence for years, I guess? Despite the fact Bibi has explicitly denied there will ever be a Palestinian state for decades, and this is a popular position among Israelis.\n\nDestiny implied the Great March of Return was not non-violent, even in the beginning, to the contrary of pretty much every human rights organization reporting on the event, he also got the months wrong and Finkelstein calls him out on that.\n\nDestiny apparently wants evidence that Gaza was a bad place to live and questions the validity of every single human rights report and scholarship which has been done about Gaza, the only reason? Relatively low child mortality and relatively high life expectancy. With that logic, I suppose Cuba has a higher living standard that the United States? North Korea has a relatively high life expectancy, I guess the tankies were right about Kim Jong-Un then? Gaza has had for a long time around 40 % unemployment, it survives purely off of foreign aid, the population outside of some workers in Israel and Egypt are prevented from leaving, most of the water is polluted, it's enormously population dense and is subjected to regular massacres, which kills mostly civilians, sometimes over a thousand or two thousand.\n\nThere's other stuff he's said that's pretty horrifying, like how children from \"that part of the world\" shouldn't count as \"children\" because they're child soldiers, but that wasn't brought up in this debate. If it was, Finkelstein probably would've ripped his head off.\n\nI'll add to this post if there's other things he spoke on that i can remember. I was thoroughly unimpressed.\n\nEdit: There were two arguments so stupid I actually forgot them. One of them is the \"if Israel don't kill everyone, that exonerates them\" and \"that it's not premissible to acquire territory through war is a stupid rule and should be ignored and it doesn't matter\". That was just unbelievable.\n\nThis isn't an argument, but it's pretty clear when he's giving his own monologues that he's just not on the level of the other ones. Instead of contructing serious arguments, for example he says that just because a civilian dies in a war doesn't mean it's a war crime,that's just just inane fluff that isn't relevant to the conversation, it's a transparent attempt to seem like he's involved and on the ball. It's like saying Israel isn't allowed to nuke Gaza, it's just an irrelevant comment.\n\nEdit: Destiny giggles at the idea of Israeli snipers targeting children. This (https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children) is an LA times opinion article from a doctor who travelled to Gaza and what he saw there. I recommend reading the entire article if you can stomach it, it's pretty brutal. Here's one paragraph:\n\n\"I stopped keeping track of how many new orphans I had operated on. After surgery they would be filed somewhere in the hospital, I'm unsure of who will take care of them or how they will survive. On one occasion, a handful of children, all about ages 5 to 8, were carried to the emergency room by their parents. All had single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan Yunis, about 2.5 miles away from the hospital, after Israeli tanks had withdrawn. But the snipers apparently stayed behind. None of these children survived.\"",

If you want to debate substance of what *you* just said:\n\n1) you didn't link the guardian article and just gave one small snippet that did not say anything about there not being a Hamas compound. \n\n2) \"anyone with eyeballs\" is such a stupid comment. Clearly Palestinians have lost more and more territory as they only try to fight, lose, and move back to prior agreements. You can't expect to have everything handed back to you after you refuse to make peace over and over again. With a clear intent to remove a group of people off the face of the planet. Give me a fucking break. If Palestinians wanted that territory, maybe they should've taken any of the number of deals offered from 1950-camp David. \n\n3) \"willing to hear\" is not a standard for genocide. No amount of finger pointing at number of civilians killed changes the fact that Israel is performing the necessary cost benefit analysis of conducting urban ware fare in a densely populated zone, where the enemy uses its own civilians as human shields. Let me ask you a serious question - what should Israel realistically do? Immediate ceasefire, forget about the hostages, and just accept being constantly attacked for generations? What a stupid fucking comment my god. You don't give a shit about anything but virtue signaling for terrorist organizations. You're actually a disgusting person. \n\n4) in regards to Gaza quality of life - destiny is making statements in response to the mainstream narrative that it is \"unlivable\". The facts you pointed out go directly in the face of those stupid narratives people like you spread. No, it's not the only metrics that matter. But it shows how stupid reporting has been in this matter, and idiots like you just eat it up. \n\nBut this conversation has fundamentally been about who is acting in good faith here. Finklestein is not. He never once responded with facts despite being a \"historian\" who's spent his life on the topic. Finklestein is a literal grifter, who makes nonsensical arguments to the point of outright lying to get people like you to eat it up and spread this propaganda. You don't care about anything getting better in Gaza. You care about virtue signaling and misinterpreting any point made in the contrary to your \"beliefs\" to the point of straw man. Just all around horrible engagement with the material and I think you need to rewatch with an actual open mind.",

Not only is this blatantly false, but he explicitly called Finkelstein a liar, even though he has no idea what he's talking about.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/israel-clears-military-gaza-beach-children)\n\n>\n\nDestiny says Palestinians rejection of the Camp David Summit offer is proof that it's impossible to make peace with them (until they abandon armed resistance alltogether).\u00a0[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/174lotx/camp_david_peace_plan_proposal_2000/)\u00a0is the map of the final offer. Anyone with eyeballs can look at the map and see it's a completely unreasonable offer and the Palestinians were completely legitimate in rejecting it.\n\nDestiny says the Palestinian position is \"delusional\", despite the fact that pretty much the entire world supports the Palestinian position, only Israel and the US rejects it. Ever single year the vote in the UN assembly is around 159-7. I guess the entire world is wrong and only Israel is rational?\n\nDestiny says \"plausible\" is an incredibly low standard, what he's forgetting is that it's not like if Israel barely clears the bar for not committing genocide that points to a serious and professionally run campaign that respects international law. Officially, this is supposed to be a serious war only targeting Hamas, the fact that things have gone so horribly that 15 out of 17 judges are willing to hear out whether a genocide is being committed is a sign turns have turned pretty horrible. The US campaign in Iraq was quite nasty in many ways, but no one thinks it's a remotely plausible genocide, and for that war it's pretty much a given across the entire political spectrum outside the neocons you oppose the Iraq War, primarily on moral grounds.\n\nDestiny has implied the casualty rates are normal,\u00a0[nothing is further from the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/193f3e1/comparing_civilian_deaths_in_gaza_to_other/). And this goes for almost any metric you use, the casualty rates are atrocious. Can anyone name a war where almost as many women die as men?",

Despite the fact Bibi has explicitly denied there will ever be a Palestinian state for decades, and this is a popular position among Israelis.\n\nDestiny implied the Great March of Return was not non-violent, even in the beginning, to the contrary of pretty much every human rights organization reporting on the event, he also got the months wrong and Finkelstein calls him out on that.\n\nDestiny apparently wants evidence that Gaza was a bad place to live and questions the validity of every single human rights report and scholarship which has been done about Gaza, the only reason? Relatively low child mortality and relatively high life expectancy. With that logic, I suppose Cuba has a higher living standard that the United States? North Korea has a relatively high life expectancy, I guess the tankies were right about Kim Jong-Un then? Gaza has had for a long time around 40 % unemployment, it survives purely off of foreign aid, the population outside of some workers in Israel and Egypt are prevented from leaving, most of the water is polluted, it's enormously population dense and is subjected to regular massacres, which kills mostly civilians, sometimes over a thousand or two thousand.\n\nThere's other stuff he's said that's pretty horrifying, like how children from \"that part of the world\" shouldn't count as \"children\" because they're child soldiers, but that wasn't brought up in this debate. If it was, Finkelstein probably would've ripped his head off.\n\nI'll add to this post if there's other things he spoke on that i can remember. I was thoroughly unimpressed.\n\nEdit: There were two arguments so stupid I actually forgot them. One of them is the \"if Israel don't kill everyone, that exonerates them\" and \"that it's not premissible to acquire territory through war is a stupid rule and should be ignored and it doesn't matter\". That was just unbelievable.\n\nThis isn't an argument, but it's pretty clear when he's giving his own monologues that he's just not on the level of the other ones. Instead of contructing serious arguments, for example he says that just because a civilian dies in a war doesn't mean it's a war crime,that's just just inane fluff that isn't relevant to the conversation, it's a transparent attempt to seem like he's involved and on the ball. It's like saying Israel isn't allowed to nuke Gaza, it's just an irrelevant comment.\n\nDestiny giggles at the idea of Israeli snipers targeting children. This ([https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children)) is an LA times opinion article from a doctor who travelled to Gaza and what he saw there. I recommend reading the entire article if you can stomach it, it's pretty brutal. Here's one paragraph:\n\n\"I stopped keeping track of how many new orphans I had operated on. After surgery they would be filed somewhere in the hospital, I'm unsure of who will take care of them or how they will survive. On one occasion, a handful of children, all about ages 5 to 8, were carried to the emergency room by their parents. All had single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan Yunis, about 2.5 miles away from the hospital, after Israeli tanks had withdrawn. But the snipers apparently stayed behind. None of these children survived.\"",

I didn't see that in your Righteous Victims. Even when you talked about the first Intifada, and you talked about the second Intifada, and you talked about how there was a lot of influence by Hamas, the Islamic movement, you even stated that there was a lot of antisemitism in those movements, but then you went on to say, \"But of course, at bottom, it was about the occupation.

He's not a historian at all, he can't assess the primary documents, which is why his only contribution to the first 3 hours of the debate discussing the history of the conflict was misquoting passages from Benny Morris's academic works.\n\nI don't think having people like Destiny and Rabbani is a problem despite neither of them having strong history credentials because they could both make reasonable rhetorical arguments and were approaching the discussion in good faith. But it was kind of strange to have a 2v2 debate arguing the finer details of the history of the conflict and only one of the guys there is an actual expert on the history.\n\nI think it would've gone a lot better if Lex invited an actual historian like Khalidi or someone who can argue from the pro-Palestinian side.

Also he did accuse Fink of cherry picking his quotes/references\u2014 I understand that good faith was lost between the two however, and I don't think Fink should personally attack Destiny the way he did. I also found it absurd when Destiny and Fink argued about Latin terms from the Wikipedia genocide page. In general, Destiny comes across as a well prepared debater who is clearly new to the topic and Fink comes across as someone who is actually passionate about the topic and has been. This takes away from the validity of destiny's arguments in some kind of context. It sometimes seems that Destiny isn't deep enough on the topic to have come to his conclusions on his own. He doesn't seem to actually care about the Israel/Palestine question as much. This is due to his recent interest lining up with the recent media circus around it. I actually agree with Destiny's point of view more in general on the topic, but I don't think Fink is totally unhinged for pointing out that he's gone so much deeper.",

Maybe this was such a thing, maybe it wasn't. I'll click through the Sunday video and see if I can find the context for this clip.\n\nETA: I skimmed through the Sunday clip, and the only map in it is one of Google Maps centered on Israel.

At 19:52, he clicks on Palestine correctly. Note that in Seterra, it prompts you to click on the countries one at a time. If you get it right the first time, it fills it in white. If you miss once then get it, it fills it in yellow. If you miss twice then get  it, it fills it in orange. If you miss three or more times, it fills it in red. He has almost the whole world correct on first guesses, so I'm hard pressed to think he didn't know where Israel is on a map that same day.

If you're reading a translation, then you're absorbing the translator's bias and interpretation. A scholar can absolutely account for others' bias and interpretation, but they need to understand what those biases are and how they are interpreting things. You can be a pretty solid scholar if you can rely on others to assist with that, but you're obliged to know the languages involved in a niche if you make that your life's work and want to stand at the forefront of that niche.\n\nFor example, if I were trying to translate \"J'ai fait la grosse matin\u00e9e hier\", I could literally translate it as \"I made the fat morning yesterday\", and that would be both technically correct and meaningfully wrong. A far better translation would be \"I slept in yesterday\", but depending on the context it could even mean something like \"I burnt daylight yesterday\" if it had a negative connotation. I would only know by being able to interpret the context around it, and relying on translators means any errors they make are automatically included within your work as well as any errors that you make on top of that.",
