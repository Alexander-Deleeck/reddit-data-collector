1,1c2u7ft,AntonioLeeuwenhoek,Request for Lex to hold another Israel-Palestine debate where everyone is calmer and more academic,77,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexfridman/comments/1c2u7ft/request_for_lex_to_hold_another_israelpalestine/,210,"To preface, I’d like to say that I did enjoy listening to the Israel-Palestine debate. I thought some great points were made and it was informative to listen to. However, I disagree with Lex that not tempering emotion was a necessary and good decision. Currently, sensationalist media (on both sides) obstructs facts and drives increasing polarization. My hope was that the debate would be a counter to that. In some sense, it was. I thought that Mouin Rabbani and Benny Morris were great guests. They were humble enough to admit when they didn’t know something, amicable to each other during the “smoke break” and willing to concede when the other side made a good point. That’s good debating. They didn’t take a point made against their side as an affront against themself, but rather debated the issue.

Destiny, and particularly Finkelstein, we’re the complete opposite. They resorted to personal attacks, disrespected each other, went off on tangents that had nothing to do with the topic, solely with the purpose of discrediting each other, and were wrought with anger. They didn’t debate. They argued.

I mean no disrespect to Lex. He did a good job moderating, generally was hands off, but let both sides articulate their points and stepped in when things got way too heated. But, i’d like to see a debate where both sides are calm, collected, and articulate their points without resorting to personal attacks or shouting. So much of what we hear from the news is so blindly ideological to one side of another, that I believe it’s extremely important to hear the facts.

As it stands, I think the Israel-Palestine debate that Lex held was far more emotional than I think it should have been. I’d like to see a round 2 where both sides are civil and speak only to the facts.",2024-04-13 05:16:11,"[{'text': ""I'd be interested in hearing Mouin and Morris speak.

Not only is this blatantly false, but he explicitly called Finkelstein a liar, even though he has no idea what he\'s talking about.\n\nThe Guardian\n\nBut journalists who attended the scene in the immediate aftermath of the attack – including a reporter from the Guardian – saw a small and dilapidated fisherman\'s hut containing a few tools where the children had been playing hide-and-seek.\n\nDestiny says Palestinians rejection of the Camp David Summit offer is proof that it\'s impossible to make peace with them (until they abandon armed resistance alltogether). This is the map of the final offer. Anyone with eyeballs can look at the map and see it\'s a completely unreasonable offer and the Palestinians were completely legitimate in rejecting it.\n\nDestiny says the Palestinian position is ""delusional"", despite the fact that pretty much the entire world supports the Palestinian position, only Israel and the US rejects it. Ever single year the vote in the UN assembly is around 159-7. I guess the entire world is wrong and only Israel is rational?\n\nDestiny says ""plausible"" is an incredibly low standard, what he\'s forgetting is that it\'s not like if Israel barely clears the bar for not committing genocide that points to a serious and professionally run campaign that respects international law. Officially, this is supposed to be a serious war only targeting Hamas, the fact that things have gone so horribly that 15 out of 17 judges are willing to hear out whether a genocide is being committed is a sign turns have turned pretty horrible. The US campaign in Iraq was quite nasty in many ways, but no one thinks it\'s a remotely plausible genocide, and for that war it\'s pretty much a given across the entire political spectrum outside the neocons you oppose the Iraq War, primarily on moral grounds.\n\nDestiny has implied the casualty rates are normal, nothing is further from the truth. And this goes for almost any metric you use, the casualty rates are atrocious. Can anyone name a war where almost as many women die as men?\n\nDestiny says peace will only come if the Palestinians completely lay down their arms and pinky promise to never do any violence for years, I guess? Despite the fact Bibi has explicitly denied there will ever be a Palestinian state for decades, and this is a popular position among Israelis.\n\nDestiny implied the Great March of Return was not non-violent, even in the beginning, to the contrary of pretty much every human rights organization reporting on the event, he also got the months wrong and Finkelstein calls him out on that.\n\nDestiny apparently wants evidence that Gaza was a bad place to live and questions the validity of every single human rights report and scholarship which has been done about Gaza, the only reason? Relatively low child mortality and relatively high life expectancy. With that logic, I suppose Cuba has a higher living standard that the United States? North Korea has a relatively high life expectancy, I guess the tankies were right about Kim Jong-Un then? Gaza has had for a long time around 40 % unemployment, it survives purely off of foreign aid, the population outside of some workers in Israel and Egypt are prevented from leaving, most of the water is polluted, it\'s enormously population dense and is subjected to regular massacres, which kills mostly civilians, sometimes over a thousand or two thousand.\n\nThere\'s other stuff he\'s said that\'s pretty horrifying, like how children from ""that part of the world"" shouldn\'t count as ""children"" because they\'re child soldiers, but that wasn\'t brought up in this debate. If it was, Finkelstein probably would\'ve ripped his head off.\n\nI\'ll add to this post if there\'s other things he spoke on that i can remember. I was thoroughly unimpressed.\n\nEdit: There were two arguments so stupid I actually forgot them. One of them is the ""if Israel don\'t kill everyone, that exonerates them"" and ""that it\'s not premissible to acquire territory through war is a stupid rule and should be ignored and it doesn\'t matter"". That was just unbelievable.\n\nThis isn\'t an argument, but it\'s pretty clear when he\'s giving his own monologues that he\'s just not on the level of the other ones. Instead of contructing serious arguments, for example he says that just because a civilian dies in a war doesn\'t mean it\'s a war crime,that\'s just just inane fluff that isn\'t relevant to the conversation, it\'s a transparent attempt to seem like he\'s involved and on the ball. It\'s like saying Israel isn\'t allowed to nuke Gaza, it\'s just an irrelevant comment.\n\nEdit: Destiny giggles at the idea of Israeli snipers targeting children. This (https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children) is an LA times opinion article from a doctor who travelled to Gaza and what he saw there. I recommend reading the entire article if you can stomach it, it\'s pretty brutal. Here\'s one paragraph:\n\n""I stopped keeping track of how many new orphans I had operated on. After surgery they would be filed somewhere in the hospital, I\'m unsure of who will take care of them or how they will survive. On one occasion, a handful of children, all about ages 5 to 8, were carried to the emergency room by their parents. All had single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan Yunis, about 2.5 miles away from the hospital, after Israeli tanks had withdrawn. But the snipers apparently stayed behind. None of these children survived.""', 'replies': [{'text': 'Like I said, you can disagree with substance. If you want to debate substance of what *you* just said:\n\n1) you didn\'t link the guardian article and just gave one small snippet that did not say anything about there not being a Hamas compound. \n\n2) ""anyone with eyeballs"" is such a stupid comment. Clearly Palestinians have lost more and more territory as they only try to fight, lose, and move back to prior agreements. You can\'t expect to have everything handed back to you after you refuse to make peace over and over again. With a clear intent to remove a group of people off the face of the planet. Give me a fucking break. If Palestinians wanted that territory, maybe they should\'ve taken any of the number of deals offered from 1950-camp David. \n\n3) ""willing to hear"" is not a standard for genocide. No amount of finger pointing at number of civilians killed changes the fact that Israel is performing the necessary cost benefit analysis of conducting urban ware fare in a densely populated zone, where the enemy uses its own civilians as human shields. Let me ask you a serious question - what should Israel realistically do? Immediate ceasefire, forget about the hostages, and just accept being constantly attacked for generations? What a stupid fucking comment my god. You don\'t give a shit about anything but virtue signaling for terrorist organizations. You\'re actually a disgusting person. \n\n4) in regards to Gaza quality of life - destiny is making statements in response to the mainstream narrative that it is ""unlivable"". The facts you pointed out go directly in the face of those stupid narratives people like you spread. No, it\'s not the only metrics that matter. But it shows how stupid reporting has been in this matter, and idiots like you just eat it up. \n\nBut this conversation has fundamentally been about who is acting in good faith here. Finklestein is not. He never once responded with facts despite being a ""historian"" who\'s spent his life on the topic. Finklestein is a literal grifter, who makes nonsensical arguments to the point of outright lying to get people like you to eat it up and spread this propaganda. You don\'t care about anything getting better in Gaza. You care about virtue signaling and misinterpreting any point made in the contrary to your ""beliefs"" to the point of straw man.

Anyone with eyeballs can look at the map and see it\'s a completely unreasonable offer and the Palestinians were completely legitimate in rejecting it.\n\nDestiny says the Palestinian position is ""delusional"", despite the fact that pretty much the entire world supports the Palestinian position, only Israel and the US rejects it. Ever single year the vote in the UN assembly is around 159-7. I guess the entire world is wrong and only Israel is rational?\n\nDestiny says ""plausible"" is an incredibly low standard, what he\'s forgetting is that it\'s not like if Israel barely clears the bar for not committing genocide that points to a serious and professionally run campaign that respects international law. Officially, this is supposed to be a serious war only targeting Hamas, the fact that things have gone so horribly that 15 out of 17 judges are willing to hear out whether a genocide is being committed is a sign turns have turned pretty horrible. The US campaign in Iraq was quite nasty in many ways, but no one thinks it\'s a remotely plausible genocide, and for that war it\'s pretty much a given across the entire political spectrum outside the neocons you oppose the Iraq War, primarily on moral grounds.\n\nDestiny has implied the casualty rates are normal,\xa0[nothing is further from the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/193f3e1/comparing_civilian_deaths_in_gaza_to_other/).

Relatively low child mortality and relatively high life expectancy. With that logic, I suppose Cuba has a higher living standard that the United States? North Korea has a relatively high life expectancy, I guess the tankies were right about Kim Jong-Un then? Gaza has had for a long time around 40 % unemployment, it survives purely off of foreign aid, the population outside of some workers in Israel and Egypt are prevented from leaving, most of the water is polluted, it\'s enormously population dense and is subjected to regular massacres, which kills mostly civilians, sometimes over a thousand or two thousand.\n\nThere\'s other stuff he\'s said that\'s pretty horrifying, like how children from ""that part of the world"" shouldn\'t count as ""children"" because they\'re child soldiers, but that wasn\'t brought up in this debate. If it was, Finkelstein probably would\'ve ripped his head off.\n\nI\'ll add to this post if there\'s other things he spoke on that i can remember. I was thoroughly unimpressed.\n\nEdit: There were two arguments so stupid I actually forgot them. One of them is the ""if Israel don\'t kill everyone, that exonerates them"" and ""that it\'s not premissible to acquire territory through war is a stupid rule and should be ignored and it doesn\'t matter"". That was just unbelievable.\n\nThis isn\'t an argument, but it\'s pretty clear when he\'s giving his own monologues that he\'s just not on the level of the other ones. Instead of contructing serious arguments, for example he says that just because a civilian dies in a war doesn\'t mean it\'s a war crime,that\'s just just inane fluff that isn\'t relevant to the conversation, it\'s a transparent attempt to seem like he\'s involved and on the ball. It\'s like saying Israel isn\'t allowed to nuke Gaza, it\'s just an irrelevant comment.\n\nDestiny giggles at the idea of Israeli snipers targeting children. This ([https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-02-16/rafah-gaza-hospitals-surgery-israel-bombing-ground-offensive-children)) is an LA times opinion article from a doctor who travelled to Gaza and what he saw there. I recommend reading the entire article if you can stomach it, it\'s pretty brutal. Here\'s one paragraph:\n\n""I stopped keeping track of how many new orphans I had operated on. After surgery they would be filed somewhere in the hospital, I\'m unsure of who will take care of them or how they will survive. On one occasion, a handful of children, all about ages 5 to 8, were carried to the emergency room by their parents. All had single sniper shots to the head. These families were returning to their homes in Khan Yunis, about 2.5 miles away from the hospital, after Israeli tanks had withdrawn. But the snipers apparently stayed behind.

I've read most of Bennys books, a good amount of Finkelsteins. I read a lot of Zionist theory, and also rely a lot on eye witness accounts and video footage. It was incredibly clear to me Destiny went into this debate having made a concise decision regarding a conflict he knew maybe 20 percent about, MAYBE 20 percent. This conflict is so deep and multi layered, not to mention so much of Israeli documents that were released in the 80s changed the trajectory of how historians view this conflict. There's also still a large amount of Israeli documents still classified that would provide tremendous insight into many of the questions historians have regarding the conflict, Israel refuses to declassify them even though their limitations have expired.\n\nI disagree, as someone who is quite familiar with Bennys work, I think what he did was simply backtrack, not because he changed his mind, but because it didn't support his current argument. Also, you can't change your mind on facts, or historical accuracies. I've always respected Morris as a historian because he was committed to historical accuracy even if it made Israel look bad, as he's gotten older he's become more and more supportive of the propaganda machine, probably because Israel is losing the PR war. \n\nIs Norman Finkelstein rude, sure. Does he know what he's talking about, yes. Does he have the sources to back it up, yes. I could really care less about him insulting Destiny. Destiny is a streamer known for his racist, rude, and entitled comments, I care about the political content, that's really it."", 'replies': [{'text': ""> Also, you can't change your mind on facts, or historical accuracies.\n\nOf course you can.
