1,1c6pmne,flowersnsunshine,Adjectives vs Nouns,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexfridman/comments/1c6pmne/adjectives_vs_nouns/,2,"In light of the Edward Gibson podcast that just dropped, I thought it would be fun to share a linguistic thought I've had for a few years to see what people think.

I personally have always been very interested in language, etymology, semantics, etc...

It seems to me that, in English, nouns and adjectives are not actually distinct from one another in any meaningful functional way, only formally. We maybe use them differently in terms of properly positioning within a sentence, but they serve the same function. This function is indicate that we are targeting a smaller subsect of the entirety of things. If I say red balloons, the word red is specifying that we should target only things that are considered red, and the word balloons is specifying that we should target only things that are considered balloons (only targeting plural things is built into the noun). The phrase red balloons is then a targeting of only the things that are both red and balloons. Nouns and adjectives can both vary in the amount that they specify. Whereas proper nouns refer to a specific thing, both nouns and adjectives refer to a group of things, which share some quality or set of qualities. Sometimes people use nouns as adjectives like ""no, not that thing, the balloon thing,"" or adjectives as nouns like ""The poor eat the rich,"" but it bothers me that it is only in exceptional circumstances that it is considered proper to do so. I have often been bothered by inconsistencies in what's considered proper in a high school English class, but that could be a whole different discussion.

If there is some way that nouns and adjectives are functionally, rather than merely formally, distinct from one another I'd be very interested to hear it.",2024-04-18 00:15:20,"[{'text': 'I\'m a linguist. I fall more into what Gibson called Constructionism. He didn\'t quite say it but the idea is that language is stored and recalled as chunks rather than individual words. So for example ""salt"" is a word and ""pepper"" is a word. But that fact that we almost all always say ""salt and pepper"" indicates that we store one chunk ""salt and pepper"" rather than three words being pulled up. In fact psycholinguistic tests show that other brain more or less skips a beat when it hears ""pepper and salt"", indicating that there is one process for processing ""salt and pepper"" as a common chunk, and a separate process for processing ""pepper and salt"" as individual items maybe. \n\nHow does this play into your question?  The brain is simply looking for the simplest ways to produce thoughts and recall information. A ""balloon"" is a thing that can stand on its own: ""go get the balloon""â€¦which balloon ""the red one"". Red cannot stand on its own. Turns out the brain likes subdividing and only really using the simplest subsets. We may even distinguish between ""big red balloons"" vs ""small red balloons"". The adjectives allow us to store a simple form ""balloon"" and modify in the simplest ways. We don\'t need separate lexical items for ""balloon"" , ""big balloon"" , ""red balloon"" and ""big red balloon"". Does that make sense?  They have separate functions but ultimately it saves processing power by being able to subdivide and specify but only specify as much as needed. I wouldn\'t say ""big red balloon"" if all the balloons were of the same size, or color.  I only need that construction if color AND size vary. So ultimately the adjectives and nouns specify but in quite different ways.', 'replies': [{'text': 'Oh and strict parts of speech only exist in text books. Nominilizarion (making something a noun) is super common for adjectives. We can say ""the poor"" in a political speech and mean ""the poor who don\'t make above the federal poverty income"". It\'s a shorthand. Our brains are really good at extrapolating the whole meaning. So in that case ""poor"" essentially becomes a noun. So it\'s no longer serving its standard purpose of modifying. The modifier has become the thing. This gets into the idea of semantics and meaning which is fascinating. Ultimately words don\'t matter, meaning is the goal and we can really manipulate language and to creat clear, concise meaning that is least taxing on the brain. \n\nGibson talks a lot about embedded clauses and distant dependencies. That\'s why those just don\'t work in natural language. The meaning is too taxing on the brain, and there are far too many points were the wrong meaning can be introduced.', 'replies': []}]}]",2024,4,18
